Fews is a clone of the website google News, created as a school project. The design is very similar to the original site.

## DESCRIPTION
Fews is a website where you can browse through latest news articles all over the world. You can search it with words/sentences (exclude words, include words, exact phrase and date), or with a country.
The website also allows users to signup/signin with regular signin system or with Google/Facebook/(Github - currently in development) and save/follow news articles. Profile costumization is also available. Admins can add new users roles and put news on trending page (headlines)
Weather is shown based on your location. You can switch between Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F) and Kelvin (K).

## INSTALLATION
Download the files and place them in a folder. Import the database into MySQL.
You will need to set up your own API keys on <a href="https://newsapi.org/">News API</a>, <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/">Weather API</a>
If you want to use the Google and Facebook login, you will have to request your own API key for both of them. Once you do that and replace it, it should work.

## CONTRIBUTING
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## LANGUAGE
Both Frontend and Backend are made in English.
